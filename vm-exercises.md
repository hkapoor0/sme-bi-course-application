# Virtual Machine (VM) Exercises

## :information_source: Read this before getting started
- The two exercises should not replicate the exact actions shown in your screencast. The goal of exercises is for learners to apply what was learned in the screencasts to new problems or situations. This is best pedagogical practice for retaining and building skills. For example, this can be done by using another dataset between screencasts and exercises or focusing on a different portion of the dataset.
- We can only run free versions of BI software in our virtual machine exercises. In the case of Power BI, make sure the exercises can run on [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) without any additional paid products. 
- Unsure what the scope of an exercise should be? Here's an [example](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi/getting-started-with-power-bi?ex=14) from Introduction to Power BI. The first chapter of most DataCamp courses are free, so take a look at our [BI courses](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses?technologies=Tableau&technologies=Power%20BI) to get a feel for how we assess and guide learners.

## 1st VM Exercise

#### Dataset

- [ ] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [ ] **Initial**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-intial.twbx` or `ex-1-intial.pbix`, depending if you are auditioning for a Tableau or Power BI course.
- [ ] **Solution**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-sol.twbx` or `ex-1-sol.pbix`

#### Learning Objective

*Learners will be able to learn the correlation function using windows function*

#### Context

* Windows functions in Tableau are strong tools that aid in improving the effectiveness and lowering the complexity of queries that evaluate data set partitions. Windows functions when used with correlation functions are vaery helpful in deriving relationship between measures and calculating persons coefficient. Such instruments are in handy in real-world situations for weather forecasting, predicting temperature variations, research, analysis, etc*


#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Below are the steps that are required to be executed by the student*

- Drag a date field to rows and two measures to columns shelf using measure name field
- Drag measure value to text under the marks section 
- Create two caluclated fields, one for correlation function and the other for windows correlation function 
- Format the two fields(number digits) and add them to the view
- Observe the difference and check for the consistency of windows correlation function.

#### Exercise question:

Question) Which of the following is true about WINDOWS function? (Select any one)

•	WINDOWS function are complex and inefficient
•	WINDOWS function does not cause rows to be grouped together
•	Aggregate functions return multiple values
•	WINDOWS functions don't use over clause


#### End goal:

## 2nd VM Exercise

#### Dataset

- [ ] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [ ] **Initial**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-2-intial.twbx` or `ex-2-intial.pbix`, depending if you are auditioning for a Tableau or Power BI course.
- [ ] **Solution**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-2-sol.twbx` or `ex-2-sol.pbix`

#### Learning Objective

*Learners will be able to learn the covariance function using windows function*

#### Context

*Windows functions are powerful tools in tableau that are helpful in increasing the efficiency and reducing the complexity of queries that analyze partitions of data set. Using windows functions along with correlation functions act as a useful tool for summarizing and visualizing the strength of relationship between continuos variables. In real life scenarios, such tools are handy in researches, studies, analysis in medical/life sciences (example correlation between body fat and workout is that of 1), engineering, construction, navigation, etc.*

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Below are the steps that are required to be executed by the student*

- Drag a date field to rows and two measures to columns shelf using measure name field
- Drag measure value to text under the marks section 
- Create two caluclated fields, one for covariance function and the other for windows covariance function 
- Format the two fields(number digits) and add them to the view
- Observe the difference and check for the consistency of windows covariance function.


#### Exercise question:

 Question) Which of the following is true about WINDOWS function? (Select any one)
 
 •	WINDOWS function require the user to provide a start date and end date
 •	WINDOWS function does not require the user to provide a start date and end date
 
 
#### End goal:

*Add an image of the final visualization here.*
